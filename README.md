Hacking total cost to buy all the clocks and watches in the store [Shopicruit](http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/)

## Overview
I implemented this application with scaling up in mind
- Used [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) to get Data Injection properly and [Data Binding Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) to architecture as MVVM
- Used [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) as HTTP Client, [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to handle networking asynchronously, [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to parse json and map them to POJO
