Hacking total cost to buy all the clocks and watches in the store [Shopicruit](http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/)

- Used [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) as HTTP Client, [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) to handle networking asynchronously, [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to parse json and map them to POJO

## Requirement to run
